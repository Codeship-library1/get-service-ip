# Get the IP of a running container during a Codeship Pro build

_You can run `jet steps` against this repo to see example output. [Download the Jet CLI](bit.ly/codeship-jet-tool)._

In some cases, you may need to get the IP of a running container during a Codeship Pro build, and `links` won't suffice -- likely because you need bidirectional communication between containers.

In this example, `app1` and `app2` must be able to communicate with one another. Since containers running during a Codeship Pro build don't run on the same network (yet!), we'll have to get addresses and ports manually.

In this scenario, `app1` knows how to comminicate to `app2` via the env vars set from the `link`. `app2` knows where to find `app1` from extra step we'll add below that will set the IP address of `app1` in an env file.


### Add a Docker service to `codeship-services.yml`
Create a `docker` service that will be able to inspect containers running on the host system. We'll use this service to find the IP, and then write that to an env file that you other services can consume via a mounted volume.

```
docker:
  build: .
  add_docker: true
  volumes:
    - ./tmp:/tmp
  links:
    - app2
```

### Add a step to get the IP address for the desired container

There's a little script at `bin/get_service_ip` that will filter running containers by image name, then inspect that container. We can get the IP address from the inspect results using handy formatting. *You need to change this script to suit your needs*. There are several [filtering options](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/#filtering).

Then, print out that value to an env file. The file is shared across containers via the volume.

There's also a handy `printenv` step for `app2` just to verify that the env vars generated by the `link` to `app2` are being set appropriately (and automatically).

### IP Address != service readiness

Note that existence of an IP address doesn't mean that the service is healthy or consumable. You'll still need to add a healthcheck or other script to wait for service readiness.
